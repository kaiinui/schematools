[WIP] schematools
===========

I will provide a toolset for painless API development

- api_builder (build an API endpoint from a JSON Schema powered by Grape DSL)
- ios_client (provides iOS Client powered by Mantle + Overcoat)
- android_client (provides Android Client powered by Retrofit + Gson)
- javascript_client (provides JavaScript Client via JSONP)
- apidoc (generates an API document, which can try API request interactively on the document, powered by swagger-ui)
- localpublic (provides a way to try API from your iPhone, Android without publishing the app, powered by ngrok)
- schema_smith (generates JSON Schema from ActiveModel, or other way.)
